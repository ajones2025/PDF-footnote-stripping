INTRODUCTION  
For many religious people, the words of the Bible are considered divine, and thus, the chances that  
contradictions and errors exist in the biblical text are slim, if not impossible. If there is an error, it is an error  
in the interpretation or the interpreter’s assumptions, not in the Bible. In many Christian and Jewish circles,  
including the Egyptian Presbyterian community to which I belong, the situation is even more complicated.  
Many believers are overly concerned with a biblical hermeneutic that ardently presupposes the scientific  
historicity of whatever is in the Bible. This presupposition depends on the belief that historians and biblical  
scholars have proved the factuality of the biblical words. To be fair, some scholars have indeed tried, at times  
successfully, to confirm the historicity of biblical events. However, to a greater extent, the conclusions of  
most historical-critical studies contradict this biblical factuality presupposed by many religious believers.  
This conflict is the foundation for the tension between the faith of religious communities and historical- 
critical scholarship. Many faithful Christians and Jews believe the Bible to be trustworthy because it is  
historically accurate, whereas historical-critical studies strongly contest this latter statement. This present  
study aims to make a modest contribution to the many attempts to resolve this tension.   
The essay argues that some biblical evidence suggests that ancient biblical authors 1  have had different  
perceptions of history and historiography. In addition, the evidence pushes against claims for the universality  
of the standards for examining ancient literature—its historicity and coherence, for example. 2  The main  
priority of biblical authors seems to have been to offer stories that function as exhortations for readers who  
are approaching the text “in submission, with a desire to learn its lessons.” 3  Therefore, it was vital for these  
authors to decide on the best method to transmit their historical events in ways that meet this desire. “We see  
1 2 3 

that that author … had two choices: He could present the truest version of the bare facts, at the risk of losing  
the true message of the story. Or he could ensure that we come away with the true lesson … at the expense of  
factual accuracy.” 4  The Dead Sea Scrolls and other writings of early Jewish communities show us examples of  
communities that seem to have realized in their sacred scripture what historians would delineate as historical  
inaccuracies and still sanctified these texts in their own ways. 5  Early Jewish communities noticed the assumed  
historical differences or contradictions yet approached them differently from historical critics and modern  
faithful believers. “It is not the historical David and Saul, or Leah and Dinah which occupied the center of the  
Rabbis’ interest. These had already died—what happened, happened—and their judgment is given over to  
Heaven … It is much more important to the Rabbis to describe the characters in a way which would be  
instructive, and it makes no difference who or what really was.” 6  Extrabiblical evidence asserts then that there  
could be a way to delineate a text as true and trustworthy even if it does not accord strictly to modern  
historical-critical standards for factuality. If that is true of these communities, one may also imagine it being  
true of biblical times. Biblical authors perhaps have a distinctive perception of history and historiography,  
more similar to the one we see in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Rabbinic texts. 7  If our reading of the evidence in  
Chronicles and its  Vorlagen  is correct, we invite bible scholars and believers to rethink their equation of  
historicity with linear factuality and begin approaching and evaluating biblical historical claims more in line  
with the cultural intuitions of biblical authors that are derived from the text itself. 8  To do this, one must  
4 5 6 7 8 

adopt the rigor of historical and literary criticism  and simultaneously  respect biblical authors’ cultural  
perceptions, faithfulness, and the sacredness of the biblical text. Arguably, this approach could present hope  
for a reconciliation between the two poles: faith and historical-critical scholarship.    
This study is divided into two parts. The first will be concerned with delineating some of the  
compositional strategies of biblical authors in writing their histories. We will focus on the book of Chronicles  
because it “provides clear examples of how at least one biblical historian worked and may shed light on the  
work of earlier historians.” 9  Firstly, we will show that, unlike the conjectures of many scholars, the exegetical  
practices often associated with the book of Chronicles and other so-called rewritten scripture texts 10  are not  
exclusive to them but are continuing the literary inner workings that are already in place within other books  
of the Hebrew Bible, including the Chronicler’s  Vorlagen : Samuel-Kings. By focusing mainly on the primary  
evidence to discern how ancient authors wrote their histories, we highlight the incongruency between ancient  
and historical-critical understandings of historiography. Still, this section emphasizes the inevitability of  
historical-critical tools for describing ancient historiographic standards. 11     
The second part of this essay will tackle some implications of the conclusions reached in the first  
section on the tension between faith and historical-critical studies. We will converse with some ideas posited  
by Jon D. Levenson and Joshua Berman, who tackle this tension. We contend that this tension might begin to  
resolve if believers and historical-critical scholars reexamine their preoccupation with historicity and  
9 10 11 

maintain a type of approach to the Bible that is more nuanced and dependent on the ways ancient  
understood and wrote their histories.  
  
THE COMPOSITIONAL NATURE OF THE BOOK OF CHRONICLES: A BRIEF HISTORY OF  
SCHOLARSHIP  
  
[ This section is an adaptation of a more extended history of scholarship in my thesis. There, I also survey the  
work of many scholars, including Julius Wellhausen, Pancratius Bornelis Beentjes, Simone De Vries, W. M. L.  
De Wette, Peter Ackroyd, Isaac Kalimi, Hugh Williamson, Sara Japhet, Michael Fishbane, Gray Knoppers,  
Ralph w. Klein, Thomas Willi, and Steven L. McKenzie .]   
  
Ever since Julius Wellhausen's  Prolegomena , no agreement has arisen among scholars regarding the nature of  
the composition of the book of Chronicles. 12  Some have classified it as a midrash, 13  while others have taken it  
as a history book (both in Leopold Ranke’s definition and otherwise), 14  exegesis, 15  or a theological  
reinterpretation of its  Vorlagen. 16  While some of these qualifications—such as exegesis—are not far off the  
12 13 14 15 16 

mark, their exclusive designation to the book of Chronicles is. This limitation in Chronicles research reflects  
scholars' inability to take into consideration the totality of the literary evidence found in Qumran, which, as  
some have argued, reflects that rewriting presents a literary continuum—comprising the book of Chronicles  
and many other Second Temple texts, including major parts of the Hebrew Bible—from earlier sources.  17    
  
In her monograph,  Genres of Rewriting in Second Temple Judaism , Molly Zahn identifies rewriting  
not as a distinct genre of texts but as a literary method that has taken two forms:  revision and reuse . 18  The  
difference between those two forms depends on the context.  Revision  texts rewrite the source to produce a  
new copy, while  reuse  utilizes a source text to create new work. Therefore, while Zahn has perceived the book  
of Chronicles as a new work, she has shown that the book should still be classified as a clear example of  
rewriting, even if its processes are broader than mere copying or paraphrasing. Christophe Nihan discusses  
the impact of the discoveries of Samuel manuscripts in Cave 4 of Khirbet Qumran on our understanding of  
the composition and nature of the book of Chronicles as rewritten scripture. 19  He notes that the revisional  
and rewriting activities many scholars see in Chronicles are not exclusive to it and are present—perhaps to  
lesser extents—in other traditions of Samuel (i.e., MT Samuel or LXX Samuel). Nihan sees that these  
rewriting traditions in both Chronicles and other ancient versions of Samuel—as well as in other Qumran  
texts—“[represent] … a larger scribal trend in the Second Temple period.” 20  Nihan’s argument discloses the  
limited impact rewritten scripture scholarship had on the study of Chronicles—its inability to observe the  
17 18 19 20 

similarities between the literary techniques employed in the book of Chronicles, other rewritten scripture  
texts, and putatively “non-rewritten scripture” writings.   
  
A similar argument is also posited by D. Andrew Teeter, who says that the texts at Qumran, including  
the writings scholars designate as rewritten scripture, incorporate similar literary techniques and redactional  
activity to the ones we find in numerous other “non-rewritten scripture” texts to the extent that “one can  
frequently trace virtually seamless connections between the internal process of redaction and inner-biblical  
interpretation and the continuation of these processes within other texts of the period.” 21  These similarities,  
for Teeter, show that rewritten scripture texts—in this case, the book of Jubilees was the case at hand—are  
“continuation or further extension of traditionary processes at work in the compositional development of the  
scriptural books themselves.” 22   
  
Next, we present a case study from Chronicles (21:18–27) that further advances these arguments. In a  
more focused fashion, we show that the Chronicler utilizes similar compositional strategies as the ones found  
in the Chronicles’ assumed  Vorlagen : Samuel-Kings, particularly 2 Samuel 24:18–25. 23

CASE STUDY: 2 CHRONICLES 21:18–27 // 2 SAMUEL 24:18–25  
  
Explaining the Differences  
Thomas Willi, in his book  Die Chronik Als Auslegung , attempts to explain the differences between the two  
accounts, or rather the Chronicler’s additions to, emissions from, and alterations to his source. In agreement  
with others, Willi thinks this pericope in Chronicles should cause confusion for every attentive reader. Yet,  
he writes,  
Er bekommt aber schlagartig Sinn, wenn man ihn weniger als für sich durchkonstruierte Einheit  
denn als Typologisierung nach der Begegnung Gideons mit dem Engel Jahwes erkennt [cf. Judge  
6] … Es kann nicht verwundern, daß dem Chronisten eine Transaktion von solcher Tragweite  
wie jene des   zukünftigen Tempelgrundstücks gar im Lichte einer Abrahamtypologie [cf. Gen  
23]. 24   
  
Willi holds that the tension between 1 Chr. 21:18–27 and 2 Sam. 24:18–25 is resolved when one notices the  
allusions of the story in Chronicles to Gideon’s narrative in Judges 6 and the Machpelah episode in Genesis  
23. 25    
Unlike the case in 2 Samuel 24, where we are told that Gad came on his own with the instruction to  
build an altar for the  LORD  to avert the fatal plague (v. 18), 1 Chronicles 21 maintains that  an   angel of the  
LORD   מלאך יהוה  sent Gad to David (v. 18). This addition alludes to the story of Gideon in Judges 6:11, where  
an   angel of the  LORD   מלאך יהוה  appeared to Gideon. Another addition, namely v. 20, strengthens this allusion.  
First, the Chronicler, unlike the author of Samuel, writes that Ornan was  threshing wheat   דש חטים  when he  
saw the angel. This parallels Judges 6:11, where Gideon also met the angel while he was  threshing wheat  דשׁ  
חטים . Secondly, in 1 Chr. 21:20, Ornan  turned   וישב  to see the angel, just like Gideon in Judg. 6:18, for whom  
24 25 

his angelic visitor waited to return  שוב . Lastly, both Ornan (1 Chr. 21:20) and Gideon (Judg. 6:22)  saw   ראה   
the angel   המלאך . As noted by Willi, the allusions do not cease at v. 20. Ornan and Gideon showed features of  
generosity; the former to David (1 Chr. 21:23) and the latter to the angel of the  LORD .   Both David and Gideon  
built altars and offered sacrifices to the  LORD  (1 Chr. 21:26; Judg. 6:24–27). Further, the addition of the  
consuming fire   באש מן השמים  in 1 Chr. 21:26 clearly parallels Judg. 6:21, where  the fire  האש  that consumed  
Gideon’s sacrifice appeared. Finally, Willi observes that the negotiation section (1 Chr. 21:23–25) seems to be  
portrayed in light of Abraham’s negotiations with Ephron at the cave of Machpelah in Genesis 23. Both  
stories have a Canaanite 26  landowner offering, free of charge, a piece of land for an Israelite who insists on  
paying the full price  כסף מלא  (1 Chr. 21:24; Gen 23:12).    
  
In Willi’s view, the Chronicler is utilizing his mastery over the Law and the Prophets as well as his  
belief that the word of God is one and unchanging to write his account. 27  The Chronicler is rewriting his  
sources to show the knowledgeable reader the hidden links between one story and the other. Still, though we  
agree with Willi, we must add that his study needed to pay closer attention to the fact that the Chronicler is  
presenting a text that demands of its readers the same requisites as those required to decipher the links in the  
Chronicler’s  Vorlagen . The process, however, is made less challenging by the Chronicler by making the  
allusions more explicit. This mode of interpretation can be traced throughout Chronicles. 28  The literary  
tactics the Chronicler uses are extensions of the exegetical traditions already at play in his sources. It is  
possible, therefore, to perceive the Chronicler’s composition as a  reading and interpretive guide  for the Law  
26 27 28 

and the Prophets. 29  In the next section, I will show that the David-Gideon and David-Abraham allusions we  
just saw at play in Chronicles are also present in the book of Samuel.  
1 Chr. 21:18–27: An Extension of Existing Redactional Development 30   
David-Gideon’s Allusions in the book of Samuel   
To begin with, both Gideon and David were mighty warriors called by God to act as saviors for the people of  
Israel against their enemies. The former led the people against the Midianites, and the latter against the  
Philistines. Whereas this similarity might seem general, for the Bible contains many characters occupying  
similar roles, the stark verbal resemblance within their stories suggests otherwise. In Judg. 6, when  the angel  
of the  LORD   מלאך יהיה  appeared to Gideon, he told him, “The  LORD  is with you, valiant warrior ( יהוה עמך גבור  
החיל )” (v. 12). In parallel, we see in 1 Samuel 16 that when Saul asked for a man to relieve him from the  
torments caused by the spirit of the  LORD ,   one of the attendees said, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem  
who knows how to play [the lyre], and a valiant warrior ( גבור חיל ), a man of war, discerning, handsome, and  
the  LORD  is with him ( יהוה עמו )” (v. 18).  Only  David and Gideon in the Hebrew Bible are described as both  
being valiant warriors and having God with them.   
Though they are described as valiant warriors, their biblical text represents them as unexpected  
biblical heroes. In Judg. 6, after Gideon heard about his mission from the angel of the  LORD ,   he was  
29 30 

astonished that God had chosen him. He asked, “But  LORD ,   how can I save Israel, for my clan is the smallest  
in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s house ( ואנכי הצעיר בבית אבי )” (v. 15)? Though not as  
explicit, we know that David is also the youngest in his father’s house. In 1 Sam. 16, Jesse told Samuel, in  
reference to David, that “the youngest ( הקטן ) is remaining still, but he is shepherding the flock” (vv. 10–11),  
and therefore, no one expected his anointing. His father did not even think bringing him before Samuel and  
his brothers was necessary.  
David-Abraham Allusions in the book of Samuel   
The penultimate chapter of 1 Samuel, chapter 30, is full of David-Abraham allusions. Firstly, Abraham and  
David had relatives who were taken prisoners, and their property was plundered. In Genesis 14, Abraham’s  
nephew, Lot, was taken as a prisoner by the four victorious kings (vv. 11–12). Likewise, in Samuel 30, while  
David was in battle, his wives were taken captive by the Amalekites (v. 5). As a result of these horrible  
incidents, Abraham and David decided to set out against their enemies. Both defeated the large enemies of  
their adversaries with only a small band of soldiers and brought back the captives (cf. Gen. 14 and 1 Sam.  
30:9–20).   
More intriguingly, in both stories, David and Abraham insisted that everyone should receive their  
share in the plunder,  even those who did not fight . Abraham refused to take anything from the King of Sodom  
that did not belong to him; he only required compensation for the food of the men who fought with him in  
addition to the share of Aner, Eschol, and Mamre, who do not seem to have joined the fight (Gen. 14:22–24).  
In 1 Sam. 30, after defeating the Amalekites and taking the plunder, David ensured that not only the 400  
combatants had received their share but also the other fatigued 200 who did not partake in the fight. (vv. 21– 
24). 31    
31 

It is also worth demonstrating that in the Hebrew Bible—apart from Chronicles—only Abraham and  
Gideo are described as dying in a good old age  בשיבה טובה . Only in Chronicles do we learn that also David  
died in a good old age  בשיבה טובה . One could thus postulate that besides the explicit allusions to Abraham  
and Gideon in the episode at the threshing floor (1 Chr. 21:18–27), this additional two-in-one allusion is  
another manifestation by the Chronicler of the allusions that already exist between David and Abraham and  
between David and Gideon in his  Vorlagen . It seems that the Chronicler both realized the David-Abraham  
and the David-Gideon allusions and decided to bring them all together in his own composition by adding the  
phrase  בשיבה טובה  in David’s eulogy.   
The Chronicler has composed a text that continues the literary tactics found in earlier source texts,  
guiding the readers through the tectonics of the  Vorlagen ’s historiography. In light of this evidence, it is fair  
to say that the kind of historiography we see in Chronicles and Samuel, among other biblical—and  
extrabiblical texts—differs from modern understandings and practices of history writing. The priorities of  
biblical historians, such as the Chronicler and the author of the book of Samuel, are providing exhortations  
based on the interpretation of their stories and comparing their heroes rather than accurately recording their  
history on the basis of the scientific method. The book of Chronicles should be understood as one of the  
earliest  textbooks  for ancient Jewish literary practices used in writing Israel's history. This exegetical approach  
to writing and rewriting history we see in Chronicles and its  Vorlagen  calls for evaluating scholarly standards  
of biblical historiography—primarily focused on factuality and ideology—through a close analysis of the  
literary strategies and techniques used by the biblical authors in their historiographic writings. 32

FAITH AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM: A DISCUSSION WITH JON D. LEVENSON AND JOSHUA  
BERMAN  
  
[ This is an adaptation of a more extended section of my thesis where I also converse Van A. Harvey and Yair  
Zakovitch. ]   
  
In  Genres of Rewriting , Molly Zahn posits, in line with other scholars, that the rise of rewriting of Jewish texts  
in antiquity accompanied the Jewish textual turn, beginning in the late pre-exilic period and arguably ending  
with the canonization of the Hebrew Bible. In contrast, the Mesopotamian textual turn was accompanied by  
a turn  away  from rewiring. 33  On the one hand, the Mesopotamian textual turn led to higher conceptions of  
textual stabilization. On the other hand, the Jewish textual turn was characterized by a greater tolerance for  
pluriformity. The Mesopotamians seem to have shown explicit discomfort with this proliferating literary  
phenomenon. 34  Their discomfort reminded me of my reaction when I first learned about rewritten scripture  
texts. How could communities perceive a text as authoritative and yet produce another composition that  
sometimes changes, contradicts, and adds to the authoritative one? I have thus decided to dedicate a part of  
my study to converse with one of the available examinations of this perturbing question by Jon D. Levenson.  
I also attempt to show how the conclusions of the first part of this paper could contribute to the ongoing  
deliberations.  
The main argument of Levenson’s third chapter of his book  The Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament,  
and Historical Criticism  is that the unity of the Torah should remain a vital component of theological and  
scholarly discussions about the text despite the fact that Mosaic authorship is dismissed in historical-critical  
scholarship. 35  While I agree with this argument, I should add that, in my view, the biblical presentation of  
Moses as the author of the Torah and the obvious historical-critical evidence for this claim's historical  
33 34 35 

improbability should not necessarily be understood as a contradiction. 36  Instead, it is possible that whoever  
inserted these authorial remarks had a literary, theological, or artistic reason for this decision. It is one of the  
central tasks of the historical-critical tool to examine the various literary functions, poetic devices, and  
probable compositional aims of ancient times, which could provide a newer view into ancient literary  
tectonics. This view could perhaps constitute an acceptable compromise for both the believer and the critic.  
The pivotal question is thus:  is there an ancient literary function or poetic device that could explain the  
presence of contradictory claims in a literary unit?   
Should we assume that we can crack open the literary signifiers of authorial intentions, the text would  
not then be one with meanings that “no one ever meant,” 37  but rather a composition that utilizes various  
literary tactics to create texts with particular meanings. This approach, influenced by the work of Brevard  
Childs 38  and D. Andrew Teeter, could satisfy the two halves of the paradox Levenson mentions: the authority  
of the Torah and the faithfulness of the biblical exegete. 39  If the historical-critical tool is utilized to investigate  
ancient literary poetics, we might find ourselves closer to the minds of the biblical authors or redactors.   
Later in his book, while discussing the problems of the Protestant contradistinction between scripture  
and tradition, Levenson says that “without attention to postbiblical tradition, scripture vanishes before our  
eyes, for the basis of religion in biblical times was not a Bible: the religion  in  the Book is not the religion  of   
the Book.” 40  While Levenson’s stance is convincing, a few remarks are in order. It is indeed historically  
probable that the books of the Hebrew Bible reflect earlier literary and religious traditions that are not  
necessarily similar to those of the Bible that are less concerned with  the Book . However, given the exclusive  
36 37 38 39 40 

textual—contra oral—access to  the Book  and its existence in some physical canon, it is not easy to  
differentiate between the religion(s)  in  the Book and that  of  the Book. In its physical—admittedly fluid and  
pluriform—canon, the Book is our only source for religion  in  and  out   of  the Book. It is also the composition  
out of which postbiblical traditions have arisen. That said, I strongly agree with Levenson’s point on the  
significance of postbiblical traditions. In his view,  
historical criticism does not afford us uninterpreted facts … ‘It too is a tradition, with its own values  
and assumptions, derived from the Enlightenment and western humanism …’ [U]nless one holds  
that the Bible does not deserve   to have survived its matrix—that the history of interpretation is only  
a history of misinterpretation—historical criticism alone cannot suffice. For were the meaning of the  
text  only  a function of the particular historical circumstances of its composition, recontextualization  
would never have occurred, and no Bible would have come into existence … historical criticism must  
learn to interact more creatively with those other [postbiblical] traditions, neither surrendering to  
them nor demanding that they surrender to historical criticism. 41   
  
With this cogent treatment in mind, we want to make one positional remark. When it comes to  
researching the literary poetics of the Bible, we should prioritize the literary strategies employed in the  
latest books of the Bible, the postbiblical traditions at Qumran—especially the so-called rewritten  
scripture texts—and early rabbinic interpretations, such as the expansionistic Targumim, over others.  
The reason for this, as this paper tried to show with the example of Chronicles, is that their faithful  
extension of the redaction development of their authoritative texts gets us as close as possible to the  
literary traditions of the Book.   
  
The richness and the literary genius in biblical writings should be navigated in their own right.  
By tracing the mechanism of scribal compositions, which has been made more explicit in Chronicles, we  
have a good chance of adequately understanding and evaluating the biblical corpus. From a pragmatic  
point of view, the burden of making these discoveries falls on biblical scholars and researchers, who, in  
due course with a certain level of preparedness, can produce accessible literature for the layperson and  
the scholar that will train them, on the one hand, to think accurately about biblical conceptions of  
41 

history, historiography, and myth and, on the other hand, by accurately describing the grammar of  
biblical composition, teach them how to read the biblical texts.   
  
Recently, Joshua Berman published his semi-popular book  Ani Maamin: Biblical Criticism,  
Historical Truth, and the Thirteen Principles of Faith , which deals with the tension between historical  
criticism and faith. This book constitutes an excellent culmination of our proposed resolution for this  
tension. Berman argues that in order to understand and properly evaluate the events in the Bible, “we  
need to understand how the Torah reports … [events] …, we need to understand how the cultures of the  
ancient world reported historical events generally.” 42  Berman untangles the strategies of historiography  
in the Bible by analyzing them within their ancient Near Eastern context. Furthermore, Berman  
emphasizes the function of the events narrated in the Tanakh. He believes that the authors of the Tanakh  
were not so much concerned with providing their readers with factual events. Rather, their main priority  
seems to have been to offer stories that function as exhortations for readers who are approaching the text  
“in submission, with a desire to learn its lessons.” 43  Therefore, it was vital for these authors to decide on  
the best method to transmit their historical events in ways that meet this desire. “We see that that author  
… had two choices: He could present the truest version of the bare facts, at the risk of losing the true  
message of the story. Or he could ensure that we come away with the true lesson … at the expense of  
factual accuracy.” 44   
It should be clear that this present study agrees with Berman's conclusion. His approach and  
main ideas are vital for resolving the tension between historical criticism and faith. Historical-critical  
scholarship must revise its evaluative standards for the biblical events and not rush into discrediting the  
historical claims of the text on the basis of anachronistic views of the notions of historiography, history,  
42 43 44 

and myth. Instead, Berman suggests it should seek to understand and evaluate the text according to the  
ancient criteria of these concepts. Nonetheless, Berman's method gives more attention to the ancient  
Near Eastern context of the Bible than the biblical text itself. This attention shows Berman's preference  
for the comparative method. Consequently, his book does not adequately describe the fullness and  
richness of the biblical literary tactics and grammar of composition for the modern reader. In other  
words, Berman's arguments convincingly highlight the methodological fallacies present in the modern  
historical study of the Bible. They also teach us the importance of the ancient Near Eastern background  
for understanding the biblical notions of history and historiography. However, it does not describe to  
modern readers  how to read  the Bible after adjusting these anachronistic notions.   
  
CONCLUSION   
In the first part of the present study, we tried to show that evidence from the book of Chronicles suggests that  
some of the exegetical methods employed in Chronicles, such as typology and narrative analogy, are not  
distinct to a literary genre or a group of texts, such as rewritten scripture, but are instead a continuation of a  
scribal literary trend at work in earlier biblical texts, such as the book of Samuel. We have argued that what  
we have in Chronicles is a different kind of historiography with an exegetical function that aims to disclose  
the more implicit narrative analogies and hidden interpretive links in its sources. Moreover, the  
historiographical techniques in Chronicles are not very different from the ones in its  Vorlagen . Although the  
biblical authors of Chronicles and Samuel must have understood and cared about factual historiography, this  
practice does not seem to be their main priority. They were more interested in the exegetical and exhortatory  
functions of historiography. In light of this discussion, we think that more attention should be given to the  
similarities of compositional strategies between the later books of the Hebrew Bible (e.g., the book of  
Chronicles) as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls and their earlier sources (e.g., Samuel). We also presented and  
reviewed two attempts at solving the tension between historical criticism and faith. We have argued that one  


step towards attending to this tension is for scholars to be aware of the dangers behind scholarly  
anachronistic conceptions of historiography in the study of the Bible. A more extensive study of the  
historiographic grammar and techniques in the Bible should offer both the scholar and the believer a more  
sophisticated framework for understanding the historical claims found within the biblical corpus.
