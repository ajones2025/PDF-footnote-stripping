Reading the Writing

In this article, we propose a new way of reading the Covenant Code in the book  
of Exodus. We argue for a different way of understanding the ancient writing of  
the code. Using synchronic, literary criticism of the second half of the Covenant  
Code (Exod 22:17–23:19 [Eng. 22:18–23:19]), we read the laws as five pericope- 
triads, rather than independently, on the basis of their repeated literary devices.  
The resulting parallel pericopes appear as a literary “weave.” The flow of meaning  
down the weave appears to visualize YHWH’s approach to building a holy nation.  
The identification of woven composition presents new possibilities for an inte- 
grated understanding of the literary context of specific laws. The meaning of any  
given law is a function of its place in the weave. Therefore, much of this article is  
directed at developing a more complex understanding of “context” than is usual.  
We hypothesize that  literary weaving  was an ancient scribal paradigm in this  
context, and that applying it to such texts may suggest rhetorical purpose for  
repetitions and apparent disjunctures.

14  The consonantal form here ( ) תחיה could be pointed as  piel ,  pual ,  hiphil  or  hophal  and as  
second-person masculine singular or third-person feminine singular! As the verbs in the parallel  
segments are (uniquely, in this literary unit) third-person singular and also passive ( hophal ), we  
translate as  pual / hophal  third-person feminine singular, “she shall not be allowed to live” (Dale  
Patrick,  Old Testament Law  [John Knox, 1985], 84; Sprinkle,  Book of the Covenant , 162 n. 1). 
15  The compound verb here   מֹות יּומַ ת is an emphatic use of the infinitive absolute (“to die”)  
with the third-person masculine singular  hophal  of the same verb (passive, lit., “he shall be put to  
death”). Everett Fox translates this as “is to be put to death, yes, death” ( The Five Books of Moses:  
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; A New Translation with Introductions, Com- 
mentary, and Notes , Schocken Bible 1 [Schocken, 2000], 382). 
16  This  hophal  verb   יָחֳ רָ ם means to be devoted or to banned. “The idea is that it would be  
God’s to do with as he liked. What was put under the ban was for God alone, either for his service  
or for his judgment. But it was out of human control. Here the verb is saying that the person will  
be utterly destroyed” (NET, Exod 22:20, n. 46). 
17  These three laws “differ markedly in both form and content from what precedes them.”  
(Alexander,  Exodus , 500). Some scholars consider them to be the closure of the first half of the  
Covenant Code. With others, however, we see this triad as the opening of the second half of the  
code, for syntactic and semantic reasons, as well as its  inclusio  with thread 5 (see the main text).  
As above, up to 22:16 is clearly marked by casuistic formulae (“if … then …”), but this unit follows  
an apodictic format—simple commands in the imperfect.

24   The verb   נפש in the  niphal  means here “to be refreshed” or “to be (re)souled.” 
25   The  niphal  verb, so probably reflexive in this context, “you [pl.] shall keep yourselves,” but  
it could be passive, “you shall be kept” (in all that I said to you). The active reflexive sense would  
match the parallel  hiphil  active verb in B: “you [pl.] shall not cause to remember.” These are the  
only two second-person masculine plural verbs in this thread. 
26   The word opening B (v. 17) is the usual word for “times,”  , פעמים not as in v. 14, maybe  
emphasizing the occasion rather than the pilgrimage. So, A has three festival laws, and B has three  
laws (two sacrifice laws and one firstfruit law; so A–B has 3 + 2 + 1, mirroring the 1 + 2 + 3 laws  
in threads 2–4). 
27  Literally, “the blood of my sacrifice,” as genitive of specification: “my blood-sacrifice”  
(Umberto Cassuto,  A Commentary on the Book of Exodus  [Magnes, 1967], 304). This expression  
occurs elsewhere only in Exod 34:25 of the Passover, so B.–I and B.–II here are about Passover  
regulations, assumed parallel to A.–I, the Ma ṣṣ ôt Festival. So, with Rashi, Norman Snaith (“Exo- 
dus 23:18 and 34:25,”  JTS  20 [1969]: 323–48), and Menahem Haran ( Temples and Temple-Service

READING GENDER IN JUDGES: AN INTERTEXTUAL APPROACH 
Shelley L. Birdsong, J. Cornelis De Vos, and Hyun Chul Paul Kim, editors 
Much of Judges can be understood only when read together with other parts of  
the Hebrew Bible. Narratives in Judges comment, criticize, and reinterpret other  
texts, often by troubling gender, disrupting stereotypical binaries, and creating  
a kind of gender chaos. This volume brings together gender criticism and inter- 
textuality, methods that align with intersectional lenses, to draw attention to how  
race, ethnicity, class, religion, ability, sex, and sexuality all play a role in how one is  
gendered in the book of Judges.

IMPURITY AND PURIFICATION IN EARLY JUDAISM AND THE  
JESUS TRADITION 
Thomas Kazen 
This collection of twelve essays by Thomas Kazen focuses on issues of purity  
and puriﬁ cation in early Judaism and the Jesus tradition. During the late Second  
Temple period, Jewish purity practices became more prominent than before and  
underwent substantial developments. Kazen advances the ongoing conversation  
and debate about a number of key issues in the ﬁ eld, such as the relationship  
between ritual and morality, the role and function of metaphor, and the use of  
evolutionary and embodied perspectives.

EDITORIAL TECHNIQUES IN THE HEBREW BIBLE: TOWARD A  
REFINED LITERARY CRITICISM 
Reinhard Müller and Juha Pakkala 
Editorial Techniques in the Hebrew Bible: Toward a Reﬁ ned Literary Criticism  chal- 
lenges recent skepticism about the possibility of reconstructing the diachronic  
development of the Hebrew Bible. Reinhard Müller and Juha Pakkala reﬁ ne the  
methodologies of literary and redaction criticism through a systematic investiga- 
tion of the additions, omissions, replacements, and transpositions found in  
divergent ancient textual traditions. The end result is an essential handbook and  
practical guide for students and scholars grappling with the historical develop- 
ment of biblical texts.
